This project contains a series of scripts to access, interact with and extracting data from web pages.

# webpage_interaction_selenium
This script is an example of how to use the Selenium module and the Chrome webdriver to:
-open a webpage
-input text into forms
-click buttons
-extract outputs

The example used involves accessing the Google Translate website and translating a custom phrase from one custom language to another custom language, using error-handling to deliver alternative translations where the preferred format doesn't exist.
